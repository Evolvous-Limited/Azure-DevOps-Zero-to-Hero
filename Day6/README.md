# Azure Test Plans

Azure Test Plans is a test management module within Azure DevOps that lets users manage test plans, test suites, and test cases for everyone in the software development process.

## Manual and Exploratory Testing 

### Planned Manual Testing
A test plan is a detailed document that describes software testing areas and activities.

### User Acceptance Testing
Evaluate a product, prototype, (or) software application to make sure it is up to specifications and quality before putting it into production.

### Exploratory Testing
Approach to software testing that is often described as simultaneous learning, test design, and execution.

### Stakeholder Feedback
Any information or opinion that you receive from the people who are affected by or interested in your business activities.

## Automated Testing :robot:

Software testing technique that automates the process of validating the functionality of the software and ensures it meets requirements before being released into production. 

### Integration with Azure Pipelines 🚀
Increases collaboration between product management and development teams with cross-functional transparency.

### Result Capture and Review 📃
Pipeline tasks capture and publish test results, which can be reviewed using progress and pipeline reports.

## Traceability :link:

Ability to discover information about where and how a product was made

### Linking to User Stories/Requirements
Test cases and suites are linked to user stories, features, or requirements for end-to-end traceability.
It helps in tracking the quality of requirements.

User Stories to define requirements demonstrate an intention to work collaboratively with the users to discover what they really need.

## Reporting and Analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Reporting includes creating, configuring, consolidating, organizing, formatting, and summarizing. An analysis is based on a “pull” methodology in which a data analyst uses the information to further investigate and answer business questions.

### Configurable Tracking
Change tracking and controlled change ensure that there is a record of the state of a system and if issues arise the cause.

### Built-in Reports
Quickly generate reports on all files and user activities within the repository. Keep track of every action taken on a document, with event date, time, and user that acted.

# Running Tests :running:

A run test is a statistical analysis that helps determine the randomness of data by revealing any variables that might affect data patterns.
