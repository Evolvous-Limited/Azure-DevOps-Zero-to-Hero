# Day 12/16 - Azure DevOps Advance Security | DevSecOps in Azure DevOps üîê

Azure Advanced Security from Servent helps organizations address the challenges of securing their hybrid infrastructure and data whilst meeting the growing demands of a rapidly changing threat landscape by utilizing Azure security capabilities.

Azure DevOps Advanced Security provides a range of security features to help organizations identify and address security vulnerabilities in their development processes.

- Dependency Scanning
- Secret scanning-during the push
- Secret scanning inside the repository
- Code scanning

## Dependency Scanning
Dependency Scanning can automatically find security vulnerabilities in your software dependencies while you're developing and testing your applications.

## Secret scanning-during the push
Secret scanning as push protection currently scans repositories for secrets issued by some service providers. If access to a resource requires paired credentials, then secret scanning may create an alert only when both parts of the pair are detected in the same file.

## Secret scanning inside the repository
Secret scanning for your repository scans for any secrets that may already exist in your source code across history and push protection prevents any new secrets from being exposed in the source code.

## Code scanning
Code scanning is the process of examining code to identify bugs, errors, and security flaws. Any issues found are displayed, enabling you to address them quickly and enhance the security of your application.

Azure DevOps supports enforcing certain types of conditional access policies (for example, IP fencing) for custom Azure DevOps authentication mechanisms. These mechanisms include personal access tokens, alternate authentication, OAuth, and Secure Shell (SSH) keys.

Microsoft is only responsible for securing physical hosts, networks, and the data center. Customers are responsible for securing the operating system, network control, applications, identity, and directory infrastructure, accounts and identities, devices, and information and security.
