## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is about hardware-based services (involving computing, network, and storage capacities).

Services are provided on demand.

Customers can pay for them as they go, without the need to invest in a data center.

Hardware management is abstracted from the customers.

Infrastructure capacities are elastic and can easily scale up and down.

**Cloud Computing aims purpose**

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider's network.

## IaaS VS PaaS VS SaaS

IaaS -> Infrastructure-as-a-service
PaaS -> Platform-as-a-service
SaaS -> Software-as-a-service

![IAAS PAAS ibbus](https://github.com/Ibrahimsi/Test-Azure/assets/41462796/984187bd-76d9-4af5-bf16-22db9e3b89f5)

IaaS builds the infrastructure of cloud-based technology. 

PaaS helps developers build custom apps via an API delivered over the cloud. 

SaaS is cloud-based software companies can sell and use.

## Shared Responsibility Model in Azure,

Microsoft Azure operates under a shared responsibility model for maintaining a secure environment. While Azure focuses on infrastructure security, users are responsible for data protection, access controls, and account management.

## Traditional Build and Deployment workflows

Traditional cloud computing makes use of local hardware and software, cloud computing depends on the internet and distant servers.

The workflow for deploying a process or component to an environment involves building the component, creating a packaged component, and then deploying the packaged component.

## What is the Waterfall model?

The Waterfall Model is a linear application development model that uses rigid phases: When one phase ends, the next begins.

![Waterfall model ibbus](https://github.com/Ibrahimsi/Test-Azure/assets/41462796/bfb2d5a8-75b5-4db6-8168-ac1a17d08eca)

## What were the challenges with the waterfall model?

The waterfall model has lacked interaction among phases. Users have little interaction with projects. This feedback is not taken during development. After a development process starts, changes can not be accommodated easily.

1) Lack of flexibility
2) Delayed testing and integration
3) High dependency and risk
   
## What is Agile?

Agile is not a solitary, inflexible strategy; rather, a bunch of standards and practices focus on cooperation, client input, and iterative advancement. It started in the product advancement industry yet has since spread to different fields like promoting, assembling, and even training.

1) Customer-Centric
2) Iterative and Incremental
3) Collaborative
4) Flexible and Adaptive
5) Deliver Value Early

## What is DevOps, and why does it matter?

DevOps is not a technology per se, but it covers everything from the organization to culture, processes, and tooling. 

Initial steps usually include Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), real-time monitoring, incident response systems, and collaboration platforms. DevOps adoption is growing.
